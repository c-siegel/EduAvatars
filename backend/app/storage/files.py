"""
Uploaded-File Storage

The shared file handling behind every upload: avatar models and thumbnails, background images,
profile pictures, and generated start-prompt audio. Files live on local disk under the upload
directories configured in core/config.py; the database only stores their paths.

How to use:
    from app.storage.files import save_file, sniff_image, unlink_quietly

    sniffed = sniff_image(content, {"png", "jpeg"})  # None if it's neither
    path = save_file(Path(settings.background_upload_dir) / user_id, f"{uuid4()}.png", content)
