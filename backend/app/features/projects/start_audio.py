Cached Start-Prompt Audio

A project's start_prompt (the avatar's opening line) is synthesized once, on the educator's
request, and stored — so it doesn't need to be re-synthesized on every visitor's chat load.
Invalidated whenever the prompt, voice, or TTS key changes (see service.py::update_project).
