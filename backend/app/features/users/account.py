Deleting a User Account

Removes a user and everything that belongs to them. Kept as its own service because the
deletion has to reach a lot further than the `user` row itself: the app runs on SQLite with
foreign-key enforcement off (the default), so nothing in the database stops dependent rows
from being left behind — a plain `session.delete(user)` succeeds and silently orphans them.

Why that matters (this is what the cascade below fixes)
An orphaned project keeps its `published` flag and its share slug, and `get_published_project`
only ever checks that flag — so the public chat page of a deleted account stays reachable.
Worse, `resolve_llm_key` looks its key up by the project's `user_id`, which still matches the
orphaned `userapikey` row, so that chat keeps decrypting and spending the deleted user's
provider API key. Deleting an account therefore has to take the projects, keys, saved
conversations, access logs, reset tokens, and uploaded files with it.

How to use:
