litellm Chat Integration

Every LLM provider except GWDG Arcana goes through litellm, which talks to OpenAI, Anthropic,
Gemini, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, ... with one API. Bring-your-own-key: model,
endpoint, and secret all come from the stored key record the project references
(Project.llm_api_key_id).

# The same idea as the Arcana retry (see arcana.py), but for every other provider. Why this is
# worth the added latency: measured against GWDG chat-ai with backend/scripts/gwdg_diag.sh, 9 of
# 20 *identical* requests came back as an empty-bodied 500 in ~98ms — too fast for the model to
# have run at all — while the other 11 succeeded. At that failure rate a single attempt is a
# coin flip.
#
# A 5xx, a timeout, or a dropped connection is usually transient; a 4xx (wrong key, unknown model,
# malformed request) would fail identically on a second try, so it isn't retried. RateLimitError
# is deliberately left out too: a fixed short delay rarely clears a quota, and failing fast gets
# us to the non-streamed fallback in app/features/ai/llm/__init__.py::stream sooner.
