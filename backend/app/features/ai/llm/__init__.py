LLM Chat Completion

Sends a chat turn to a project's configured LLM (large language model) provider. Most providers
go through litellm (litellm_provider.py); GWDG Arcana has its own direct HTTP integration
(arcana.py) because litellm doesn't support its RAG header/field.

How to use:
    from app.features.ai import llm

    request = llm.ChatRequest(preprompt, message, temperature, top_p, start_prompt, history)
    reply = llm.complete(api_key, request)
    for delta in llm.stream(api_key, request):
        ...

    If streaming fails before the very first delta, this falls back to the plain non-streamed call
    and yields the whole reply as one delta. The visitor then still gets an answer out of this one
    request — without it the frontend has to notice the failure and ask the LLM all over again
    (see pages/PublicChat/index.tsx), which costs a second full round trip for a reply the server
    could have fetched itself. The caller needs no special case: a single large delta just chunks
    into more sentences at once.
