GWDG Arcana (RAG) Chat Integration

Direct HTTP integration with the GWDG SAIA API for Arcana knowledge-base (RAG, retrieval-
augmented generation) chats — litellm knows neither the required "inference-service" header nor
the "arcana" field used to address the knowledge base. Also filters out the "References:" block
Arcana appends to its replies (see ArcanaReferenceGuard).
