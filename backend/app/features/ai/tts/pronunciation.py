"""
Teacher-Defined Pronunciation Rules

Applies a teacher's own word list ("pH" -> "p H", "{number} m/s" -> "{number} Meter pro Sekunde")
to the text handed to a TTS engine. Teachers edit these rules on the "Pronunciation" dashboard
page (see features/pronunciation), so unlike the built-in rules in normalizer.py they are plain
text, never regular expressions: every term is escaped, and the only pattern syntax is the
`{number}` placeholder.

How a rule matches
- A term matches literally. A space in a term matches any run of whitespace, so "z. B." also
  matches a line-wrapped "z.\nB.".
- `whole_word` (the default) only stops a term from matching inside a longer *word*: "N" doesn't
  match the "N" in "Newton", but "kg" still matches in "10kg" — units are often glued to their
  number, and that must keep working.
- `{number}` stands for a number like 5, 1,5 or 3.000,25 and is put back where the spoken form
  says `{number}` (in order, if there are several).
- All rules are applied in a single pass, longest term first, so "km/h" wins over "km", and a
  replacement is never matched again by another rule.
- If a replacement would glue onto a neighbouring letter or digit ("Δt" -> "Deltat"), a space is
  put in between, so teachers never have to think about leading/trailing spaces.

How to use:
    from app.features.ai.tts.pronunciation import PronunciationRule, compile_rules

    matcher = compile_rules((PronunciationRule("pH", "p H", case_sensitive=True),))
    matcher.apply("Der pH-Wert")  # "Der p H-Wert"
