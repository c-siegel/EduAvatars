Local Transcription Capacity

Limits how many local transcriptions (faster-whisper or Parakeet) run at the same time in this
process. Both are CPU-bound and each one already uses most of the machine's cores, so running
several at once wouldn't finish any sooner — it would just make every one slower.

How to use:
