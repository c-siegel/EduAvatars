"""
Bootstrap Admin Account

An idempotent startup step that creates or promotes an admin account from ADMIN_EMAIL/
ADMIN_PASSWORD (see core/config.py) — the way a self-hoster gets their first admin without
touching the database by hand. Run automatically by docker/backend-entrypoint.sh right after
migrations; for a non-Docker deploy, run it manually the same way.

What does it do?
- Neither ADMIN_EMAIL nor ADMIN_PASSWORD set: does nothing (most instances, most of the time).
- ADMIN_EMAIL doesn't match an existing account: creates one with that email/password, already
  an admin, flagged to change that password on first login.
- ADMIN_EMAIL matches an existing non-admin account: promotes it to admin. Never touches its
  password — only a brand-new account gets one from ADMIN_PASSWORD.
- ADMIN_EMAIL already belongs to an admin: does nothing.

Safe to run on every container start (and to leave the env vars set indefinitely) — none of the
above ever re-applies a change that's already in place.

How to use:
