"""
API Router

Collects every feature's router into one APIRouter that app/main.py mounts under API_PREFIX
(/api/v1, see core/urls.py). Registration order matters wherever two routes could match the same
path: a literal segment like /projects/import or /conversations/ids must be registered before a
parameterized sibling like /projects/{project_id}, or the generic route swallows it.
