"""
This is the main application file that creates and configures the FastAPI application.
It's the starting point for the backend server.

What is this file for?
This file:
- Creates the FastAPI application instance (create_app)
- Configures CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and the security-headers middleware
- Registers all API route handlers (collected in app/api_router.py) under /api/v1
- Provides a health check endpoint

How it works:
1. When you run the server (e.g., `uvicorn app.main:app`), this file is executed
2. The FastAPI app instance is created
3. Middleware and routes are registered
4. The server starts listening for requests
