"""
Resolving a Project's API Keys

Looks up which of a user's stored API keys a project should actually use for its LLM/TTS calls,
and works out the endpoint override (if any) to pass to litellm. Kept central so
app/api/projects.py and app/api/public_chat.py never duplicate this logic.

How to use:
