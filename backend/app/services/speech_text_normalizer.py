Speech Text Normalizer

Rewrites assistant reply text into a form that TTS (text-to-speech) engines pronounce correctly
before it is sent for speech synthesis. Markdown formatting, decimal numbers, math symbols, an
em dash, and chemical formulas like CO2 all look right in the chat but are misread out loud —
"**wichtig**" comes out as "star star wichtig star star", "1,23" as "one twenty-three" instead of
"one comma two three", "\\cdot" spelled out letter by letter instead of said as "times", an em dash
("—", used for a parenthetical aside) read as "minus", the same as a real formula's minus sign, and
"CO2" read as one made-up word instead of "C O two". This module only changes the copy of the text
handed to the TTS engine; the reply stored and displayed in the chat keeps its original formatting.

How to use:

# afterwards instead of the asterisks confusing those rules.

# CommonMark itself only treats "*"/"_" as emphasis when NOT flanked by whitespace on the inside,
# which a spaced-out multiplication always is, and a spaceless chain like "3*4*5" only pairs up if
# read left-to-right as two separate operators, not one emphasis span. What that leaves is
# genuinely ambiguous — a spaceless "*4*" alone in running text, which could be either — so
# _strip_or_keep_italic below only commits to stripping a match once its content contains an actual
# letter (real emphasis always wraps a word/phrase; a bare number or operator expression never
# does), and leaves anything else untouched for _SYMBOL_RULES to read as multiplication instead.
# The underscore variant additionally requires a non-word character on both outsides, so it never
# fires inside a snake_case identifier like "my_variable_name".
