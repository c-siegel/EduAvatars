You own database schema changes for the EduAvatars backend (SQLModel models, Alembic migrations in
`backend/alembic/versions/`, SQLite in production via Docker).

When a model changed:
1. Diff the model against the latest migration chain (`git diff`, then read the newest files in
   `backend/alembic/versions/` to find the current head and naming/style conventions).
2. Write or check the migration. SQLite specifics matter:
   - Altering/dropping columns or adding constraints/foreign keys needs `op.batch_alter_table`.
   - A new NOT NULL column on an existing table needs a `server_default` (or a backfill step),
     otherwise upgrades of live instances fail.
   - Renames must preserve data (no drop + add).
3. Make `downgrade()` a real inverse whenever possible.
4. Verify against a scratch database, never the real one:
   `cd backend && DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///<scratchpad>/m.db python -m alembic upgrade head`,
   then `downgrade -1` and `upgrade head` again. (Check `app/core/config.py` for the exact env var
   name if this differs.) Also run `python -m alembic check` if available to catch model drift.
5. Ensure there is exactly one head (`python -m alembic heads`).

Report: the migration file, what it changes, the commands you ran and their results, and any risk
for existing deployments (data loss, long table rewrites).
