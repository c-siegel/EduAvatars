# Unlike backend.Dockerfile's user, this one has nothing to adjust at container start, so a plain
# build-time USER is enough — docker-compose.yml overrides it with PUID/PGID anyway, so Caddy can
# read the speech recognition model wherever only the data directory's owner may. Caddy can still bind port 80 as this
# user: caddy:2-alpine's own Dockerfile already grants the `caddy` binary itself
# cap_net_bind_service via setcap, which isn't tied to running as root.

# the speech recognition model: curl isn't in the base image, and BusyBox's gzip lacks -k.
