# doesn't leave an extra supervisor process behind, so it behaves properly as the container's PID 1.

# pyproject.toml AND app/ both need to exist before "pip install .": setuptools builds a real wheel
# from the local package here (packages = ["app"], see backend/pyproject.toml) and fails with
# "package directory 'app' does not exist" if app/ isn't there yet (this used to be just
# COPY pyproject.toml + RUN pip install — the image never actually built that way, reproduced and
# verified locally with a bare "pip install ." missing app/).
# No separate dependency-layer caching is possible either, since pip install . always needs the
# package code — a lockfile-less requirements-only layer wouldn't be reproducible anyway (see the
# comment about the missing lockfile below).

# App user — the process doesn't need root, only write access to the mounted data directory (see
# docker-compose.yml, bind mount on EDUAVATARS_DATA_DIR:/data). Created here with a default UID/GID
# of 568 — TrueNAS SCALE's fixed UID/GID for its built-in "apps" system user, which owns app data
# directories that TrueNAS itself creates — so existing TrueNAS deployments keep working without
# any extra configuration. On any other host, set PUID/PGID (see .env.example / docker/README.md)
# to whatever owns your bind-mounted data directory; the entrypoint adjusts this user to match at
# container start, before dropping privileges to it (see backend-entrypoint.sh).
# The image itself is therefore not tied to TrueNAS — only the *default* still favors it.

# and every per-IP rate limit in app/core/rate_limit.py degenerates into one instance-wide bucket.
