# CPU-only torch, installed BEFORE sopro and pinned to the dedicated CPU wheel index. Plain
# "pip install sopro" resolves torch from PyPI's default index, which is the CUDA build — on a
# CPU-only host that pulls several GB of unused NVIDIA/cuDNN/NCCL libraries for nothing, and (as
# found while validating this service — see the project's local-TTS plan, Phase 0) can exhaust a
# small tmpfs /tmp mid-download. Once this is installed, sopro's own "torch>=2.3" requirement is
# already satisfied and pip won't touch it again.
